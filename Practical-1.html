    <p>A full stack development professional is the one who has sound technical knowledge of the key elements of development 
       <br>
        Frontend
        <br>
        Backend
        <br>
        Database management
        <br>
        Version control
        <br>
        Operating systems
        <br>
        System design 
        <br>
    
    among other details of the technology.
    
    Full stack web development is a sought-after career option today. Companies actively seek developers who have sound specializations in these multiple fields.
    
    However today, the definition of full stack is quite dynamic and in some aspects company-specific too.
    
    For example, cloud computing and deployment are some of the skills that a full stack developer should have along with the ones stated before. A full stack web developer eliminates the need to hire individual role-specific people by handling the entire application themselves.
    
    During a projectâ€™s planning phase, they are the ones who work directly with clients to understand project deliverables.</p>
